## Notes
* The URLs scraped may not work as `myjob.mu` takes down a job post after a certain time. 
* The job URL was assumed to be a "primary key" during scraping to avoid duplicate entries.
* `job_title` and `job_details` can be in French or English. 
* `date_posted` and `closing_date` are timestamps which follow `DD/MM/YYYY` format.
